This repository contains a Python notebook designed for solving and visualizing Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) using both analytical and numerical approaches. The notebook introduces basic techniques for solving ODEs in the context of physical systems and compares different numerical schemes.
📑 Contents

The notebook ODES_lab.ipynb includes:

    📖 Analytical solutions for simple ODEs using SymPy

    🧮 Numerical solutions using:

        Euler’s method

        2nd-order and 4th-order Runge-Kutta methods

    📊 Error analysis and comparison of numerical schemes

    📈 Visualizing solutions over time with Matplotlib
